Progress Update - Minjae Jang

- I brainstormed the frontend design for creating and managing AI agents: this includes outlining the UI structure, user interactions, and key components needed for agent customization.
- Tech: planning to use basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build a lightweight and flexible interface - following basic structure of other AI agents (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, etc)
- Conducted initial research on RAG to see how it could enhance the agents' capabilities.
