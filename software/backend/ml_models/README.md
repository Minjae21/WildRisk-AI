This contains all of the weights for the models used to create the final estimator:
* ```community_model_weights.keras``` and ```county_model_weights.keras``` contains the weights of the neural network
* ```rf_counties.pkl``` and ```rf_states.pkl``` contains the weights of the random forest model

The weights of the random forest for communities is too large to upload to github, so please refer directly download the weights from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hzzs5cykUizEzVTYJgEOb0F51lxLjvOW?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto
