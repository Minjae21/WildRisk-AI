1. Model Performance
- DeepSeek V4: Strong performance, esp in coding and reasoning tasks
- - For coding-heavy AI agents, DeepSeek might is better.
- Llama (Meta): Solid general-purpose model, good for reasoning and text generation
- - For general NLP and chatbot-like interactions, Llama is more widely adopted.

- Both are open source, so we can fine-tune either on our needs but Llama has better support considering deepseek is relatively new
